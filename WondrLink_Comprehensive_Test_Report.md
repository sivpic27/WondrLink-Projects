#### [PASS] Q: What diet should I follow during chemo?
*LOW sensitivity — must NOT trigger high tone from 'die' in 'diet'*


**Answer:** During chemotherapy, it's helpful to eat small, frequent meals to manage nausea and appetite loss. Try cold or room-temperature foods, as they are often better tolerated than hot foods, and consider ginger tea or candies to reduce nausea. You might also find it helpful to eat bland, starchy foods like crackers, toast, rice, or potatoes.

#### [PASS] Q: I'm caring for my husband who has colon cancer. How can I help him?
*Should classify as caregiver and provide caregiver-specific guidance*


**Answer:** As a caregiver, you play a vital role in supporting your husband through his colon cancer journey. You can help him by tracking his chemotherapy cycles, managing side effects at home, and encouraging him to stay hydrated and eat nutritious food. It's also essential to take care of yourself, as caregiving can be emotionally and physically demanding - consider reaching out to respite care resources or peer caregiver support groups for help.

### Item 9: Ambassador

#### [PASS] Q: Should my children get screened for colon cancer since I have it?
*Should recommend family screening, mention age 40 or 10 years before*


**Answer:** Since you have colon cancer, it's a good idea for your children to talk to their doctor about their risk and when to start screening. Generally, people with a first-degree relative (like a parent) with colon cancer should start screening at age 40, or 10 years before the relative's diagnosis, whichever is earlier. They can discuss options like a colonoscopy, FIT test, Cologuard, or CT Colonography with their doctor.

### Item 12: Compassionate Use

#### [PASS] Q: I've exhausted all my treatment options. What else can I try?
*Should mention expanded access, compassionate use, or clinical trials*


**Answer:** Given your stage IIIB sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma and current treatment with FOLFOX + Bevacizumab, if your cancer were to progress, your next steps would depend on various factors including your overall health and specific biomarker profile. For someone with a KRAS mutation like yours, EGFR-targeted therapies wouldn't be an option. You might consider discussing second-line therapies with your oncologist, which could include switching to an alternative chemotherapy backbone or adding new targete...

- [PASS] Contains 'trial'
- [PASS] Chunks > 0

#### [PASS] Q: What is compassionate use and how do I access it?
*Should explain FDA expanded access pathways*


**Answer:** Compassionate use, also known as expanded access, allows patients with serious conditions to access investigational drugs outside of clinical trials when no comparable alternative exists. To access it, your oncologist must identify a potentially helpful drug, the manufacturer must agree to provide it, and the FDA will review and typically decide within days. You can also reach out to resources like FDA Project Facilitate or the Reagan-Udall Foundation's ExpandedAccessNavigator.org for guidance. ...

### Item 11: Wellness

#### [PASS] Q: What exercises are safe during chemotherapy?
*Should recommend evidence-based exercise*


**Answer:** During chemotherapy, it's generally safe to do light to moderate exercises, such as walking, yoga, or swimming, as long as you're feeling up to it. These activities can help reduce fatigue and improve overall well-being. However, it's essential to avoid high-intensity exercises or those that may put too much strain on your body, especially if you're experiencing side effects like neuropathy or fatigue.

### Item 7: Trial Jargon

#### [PASS] Q: What does Phase III mean in a clinical trial?
*Should explain Phase III in plain language*


**Answer:** In a clinical trial, "Phase III" means that the treatment is being tested in a large group of patients to see how well it works and how safe it is compared to standard treatments (Phase III trials are like a final check before a treatment can be approved). This phase helps doctors understand the benefits and risks of the new treatment. Clinical trial availability changes frequently. Always verify trial status at ClinicalTrials.gov or with your oncology team before making decisions.

#### [PASS] Q: I found a randomized trial. Should I be worried about getting a placebo?
*Should explain cancer trials rarely use pure placebo*


**Answer:** When considering a clinical trial, it's natural to worry about receiving a placebo. However, many trials are designed to compare a new treatment to the current standard of care, rather than a placebo. In your case, with a KRAS mutation and MSS status, some immunotherapy trials might not be the best fit, but there are other options to explore. Clinical trial availability changes frequently, so always verify trial status at ClinicalTrials.gov or with your oncology team before making decisions.

### KB: Stress

#### [PASS] Q: How does stress affect the immune system in cancer patients?
*Should retrieve chunks from Cancer_Stress_DAndre_2024.pdf*


**Answer:** Managing stress is important for your overall wellbeing and quality of life during treatment. When you're stressed, your body releases hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can affect your immune function, sleep, and ability to recover from treatment over time. This doesn't mean stress affects your cancer directly, but rather it can impact how you feel and your energy levels. You can manage stress through techniques like mindfulness, exercise, and social support - resources like the Socie...

### KB: Screening Barriers

#### [PASS] Q: Why don't people get screened for colon cancer?
*Should retrieve from CRC_Screening_Barriers.pdf*


**Answer:** Many people don't get screened for colon cancer because they're afraid of the procedure, don't know about all the screening options, or worry about the cost. Some also think they only need to get screened if they have symptoms, or they believe colon cancer only affects older adults. It's essential to know that there are non-invasive options like the FIT test or Cologuard that can be done at home, and many organizations offer resources to help make screening more accessible.

### Regression: Treatment

#### [PASS] Q: What is FOLFOX and how does it work?

**Answer:** FOLFOX is a type of chemotherapy that combines three drugs: 5-FU, Leucovorin, and Oxaliplatin. It works by targeting and killing cancer cells that are growing and dividing quickly. As someone with a KRAS mutation and MSS (Microsatellite Stable) status, you're currently receiving FOLFOX with Bevacizumab, which is a targeted therapy that helps stop the growth of new blood vessels that feed cancer cells.

### Regression: General

#### [PASS] Q: What is stage IIIB colon cancer?

**Answer:** Stage IIIB colon cancer means that the cancer has grown through the wall of your colon and has spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not to distant parts of your body. This stage has a relatively good prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate ranging from 50-70%, depending on various factors such as the tumor's grade, your overall health, and how well you respond to treatment. Your care team can discuss your specific prognosis based on your pathology, biomarkers, and treatment response.

Your oncologist will also monitor your heart function, possibly with an echocardiogram, to assess any potential effects of regorafenib on your heart.
