### Item 11: Wellness

#### [PASS] Q: What exercises are safe during chemotherapy?
*Should recommend evidence-based exercise*


**Answer:** During chemotherapy, it's generally safe to do light to moderate exercises, such as walking, yoga, or swimming, as long as you're feeling up to it. These exercises can help reduce fatigue and improve your overall well-being. However, it's essential to avoid heavy lifting, high-impact activities, or exercises that may put too much strain on your body, especially if you're experiencing side effects like neuropathy or fatigue.

### KB: Screening Barriers

#### [PASS] Q: Why don't people get screened for colon cancer?
*Should retrieve from CRC_Screening_Barriers.pdf*


**Answer:** Many people don't get screened for colon cancer because they're afraid of the procedure, don't know about all the screening options, or worry about the cost. Some also think they only need to get screened if they have symptoms, or they believe colon cancer only affects older adults. It's great that you're taking proactive steps with your treatment, and it's essential to remember that regular screening can help detect cancer early, when it's most treatable.

### Regression: General

#### [PASS] Q: What is stage IIIB colon cancer?

**Answer:** Stage IIIB colon cancer means that the cancer has grown through the wall of your colon and has spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not to distant parts of your body. This stage has a relatively good prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of around 50-70%, but it's essential to consider other factors such as your tumor grade, location, and biomarker status, like your KRAS mutation and MSS status. Your treatment team can provide more specific information about your prognosis based on your individual...

#### [PASS] Q: What is my prognosis with stage IV colon cancer?
*Should trigger STAGE_IV_PALLIATIVE_CONTEXT*


**Answer:** Your prognosis with stage IV colon cancer is complex, and it's understandable to have questions about what to expect. Generally, the 5-year survival rate for stage IV colon cancer is around 10-15%, but this can vary depending on several factors, including your tumor's genetic markers, such as your MSI-H status, which may respond well to immunotherapy, and your BRAF V600E mutation, which could be treated with targeted therapy combinations. Many people with stage IV disease live well for years wit...

While the prognosis can be challenging, many people live well for years with stage 4 disease, and treatment options continue to expand. Your oncologist can discuss different scenarios with you, including the best-case, expected, and if-disease-progresses outcomes, and factors like your MSI-H status and BRAF V600E mutation may offer specific treatment options, such as immunotherapy or targeted therapy combi...

Many people in your situation find it helpful to have a family meeting, where you can all discuss what's going on and how you're feeling.

**Answer:** Given your heart condition, it's essential to monitor your cardiac health while on regorafenib. You should watch for symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations, and report them to your oncologist immediately. Your oncologist will also closely monitor your heart function, possibly with an echocardiogram, to assess any potential effects of regorafenib on your heart.
